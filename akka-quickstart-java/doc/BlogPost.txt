This blog post describes a simple implementation of Paxos Consensus Algorithm
using Akka (Java) Framework. Objective of this exercise is educational, to learn
more about one of the foundational algorithms of distributed systems as well as
to know more about Actor based message responding asynchronous framework like
Akka.

Problem Statement
Assume that there are some number of participants. These participants can talk
to each other and to build a consensus about among themselves without anyone 
outside the group dictating or controlling the information shared. Participants
communicate with each other via a fixed protocol - a set of wellknown requests
and responses.

Typically these participants corresponds to autonomous processes which 
communicate with each over a network; hence it is a distributed system.

The goal of the programming exercise undertaken here is to model these participants,
model the communication among these participants, introduce artificial delays
in responses by participants (because these are autonomous players in real life
with their own latencies) and then to simulate how the algorithm plays out.
